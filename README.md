## Build, Run and Debug

### Windows

The MSVC C++ compiler is used for the build. Be sure to have it [installed](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) and [available](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/reference/command-prompt-powershell?view=vs-2022) in the path.

Generate an executable (make.exe) that will be used to build the code: `maker\make.bat`

Build the debug version of the code: `make`

Build the release version of the code: `make m=r`

Run the debug version of the code: `make run`

Run the release version of the code: `make run m=r`

Clean the debug version of the code: `make clean`

Clean the release version of the code: `make clean m=r`

Debug the code: `make debug`

### Linux
